# “Modern Propositions: Predicting Ballot Measure Outcomes”  

## Problem Statement:
A ballot measure is a piece of proposed legislation (often at the state level) to be approved or rejected by eligible voters. Ballot measures are also known as "propositions" or simply "questions". Ballot measures differ from most legislation passed by representative democracies; ordinarily an elected legislature develops and passes laws. Ballot measures, by contrast, are an example of direct democracy.

The subject of ballot measures varies widely, however, common subjects include, religion, agriculture, taxation, criminal justice, labor unions, and of particular interest to me, cannabis.  




Companies and organizations spend millions each year attempting to forecast the outcomes of various ballot measures. Armies of lobbyists wine-and-dine for tiny amounts of inside information while hordes of researchers keep tabs on legislation in statehouses across the country. Being able to predict a legislative outcome can give an organization a competitive advantage in many strategic domains. Similarly, organizations on either side of the proposition issue may be interested in early detection that their outcome isn’t forecasted so they can take action (e.g. rewrite the legislation, allocate more money lobbying for their side, etc.)


## Introduction:

- In many states, the most important policy changes this year won’t come from congressional legislation, but from ballot initiatives.
- According to The Economist’s annual Democracy Index report, the United States in 2017 qualified as a “flawed democracy” for the second year running, which indicates citizens’ deepening distrust of the country’s electoral system and its politicians, among other issues. 
- Other recent analyses have sounded alarm bells, too. Congressional gridlock is worsening. Partisan polarization is increasing. The “big sort”—the geographic self-segregation of like-minded Americans—has distorted representation. So has rampant gerrymandering. As a result of both kinds of distortion, many politicians across the country do not necessarily speak with the voice of their constituents, at both the federal and state levels.
-Thus, Americans are cutting out the middleman per se, and turning to ballot initiatives.

With more and more legislative outcomes being determined through the ballot measure process: What would you do if you could predict the outcome of a ballot measure?

-Adjust corporate strategy

- Teachers and corporations in Oregon - In 2018 Oregon has the third lowest high school graduation rate in the US

- Cannabis stocks, grower in Humboldt - Canopy Growth and Tilray, and many other blue chip cannabis stocks are up well over 100% since 2016

- Ability to see where you are early in the process. Look at coefficients of feature determinants.

- Standard methods for prediction of democratic outcomes, i.e. polling, are costly and inaccurate. Brexit and the 2016 election highlighted two major problems with polling: Sample bias and the challenge of predicting not only how surveyed respondents will vote, but whether or not they will vote.
- Additional, polling may not be as effective as it once was
